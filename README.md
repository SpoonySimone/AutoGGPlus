# AutoGG+

AutoGG+ is a mod designed for Hypixel to automatically say a message when a game finishes.

# Why AutoGG+?

Compared to other exisiting AutoGG mods, AutoGG+ has some exclusive features, such as:
- **Message randomization**: Tired of Hypixel constantly blocking your message for spam? AutoGG+ automatically rotates the capitalization of your message, so it never gets blocked.
- **Customizable messages**: You can set your own custom messages, so you can say whatever you want.
- **Support for the latest Hypixel games**: AutoGG+ supports most of Hypixel games (with more to come!).
- **Nice and easy to use configuration**: AutoGG+ uses [OneConfig](https://polyfrost.org/projects/oneconfig/) as its configuration manager, allowing you to easily change the mod's options in a beautiful interface with just a click of a button (R-SHIFT by default).
